    <h1>Processing model of WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry objects</h1>


    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-invariants">
      <h1>Objectives</h1>

      <p>
        This specification does not make any guarantees about garbage collection.
        Objects which are unreachable from ECMAScript may be released after long periods
        of time, or never at all. For this reason, this specification uses the term
        "may" when describing behavior triggered by garbage collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The semantics of WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry objects is based on two
        operations which happen at particular points in time:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When WeakRef.prototype.deref is called, the referent (if it's not
          already dead) is kept alive so that subsequent, synchronous accesses also
          return the object. This list is reset when synchronous work is done using
          the ClearKeptObjects abstract operation.
        </li>

        <li>
          When an object which is registered with a FinalizationRegistry becomes
          unreachable, a call of the FinalizationRegistry's cleanup callback may
          eventually be made, after synchronous ECMAScript execution completes.
          The FinalizationRegistry cleanup is performed with the
          CleanupFFinalizationRegistry abstract operation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Neither of these actions (ClearKeptObjects or CleanupFinalizationRegistry)
        may interrupt synchronous ECMAScript execution. Because embedding
        environments may assemble longer, synchronous ECMAScript execution runs,
        this specification defers the scheduling of ClearKeptObjects and
        CleanupFinalizationRegistry to the embedding environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some ECMAScript implementations include garbage collector implementations
        which run in the background, including when ECMAScript is idle. Letting the
        embedding environment schedule CleanupFinalizationRegistry allows it to resume
        ECMAScript execution in order to run finalizer work, which may free up held values,
        reducing overall memory usage.
      </p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-liveness">
      <h1>Liveness</h1>

      <p>
        For some set of objects _S_, a <dfn>hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious</dfn>
        execution with respect to _S_ is an execution whereby
        WeakRef.prototype.deref being called on a WeakRef whose referent is an
        element of _S_ always returns *undefined*.
      </p>
      <emu-note>
        WeakRef-obliviousness, together with liveness, capture two notions. One,
        that a WeakRef itself does not keep an object alive. Two, that cycles in
        liveness does not imply that an object is live. To be concrete, if
        determining _obj_'s liveness depends on determining the liveness of
        another WeakRef referent, _obj2_, _obj2_'s liveness cannot assume
        _obj_'s liveness, which would beg the question.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        WeakRef-obliviousness is defined on sets of objects instead of
        individual objects to account for cycles. If it were defined on
        individual objects, then an object in a cycle will be considered live
        even though its Object value is only observed via WeakRefs of other
        objects in the cycle.
      </emu-note>

      <p>
        At any point during evaluation, a set of objects _S_ is
        considered <dfn>live</dfn> if either of the following conditions is
        met:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Any element in _S_ is included in any agent's [[KeptAlive]] List.
        </li>
        <li>
          There exists a valid future hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution
          with respect to _S_ that observes the Object value of any object in _S_.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <emu-note>
        The intuition the second condition above intends to capture is that an
        object is live if its identity is observable via non-WeakRef means. An
        object's identity may be observed by observing a strict equality
        comparison between objects or observing the object being used as key in
        a Map.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Presence of an object in a field, an internal slot, or a property does
        not imply that the object is live. For example if the object in
        question is never passed back to the program, then it cannot be
        observed.

        This is the case for keys in a WeakMap, members of a WeakSet, as well
        as the [[WeakRefTarget]] and [[UnregisterToken]] fields of a FinalizationRegistry
        Cell record.

        The above definition implies that, if a key in a WeakMap is not live,
        then its corresponding value is not necessarily live either.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Liveness is the lower bound for guaranteeing which WeakRefs that
        engines must not empty. In practice, liveness as defined here is
        undecidable and engines use conservative approximations. There is
        expected to be significant implementation leeway.
      </emu-note>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-execution">
      <h1>Execution</h1>

      <p>At any time, if a set of objects _S_ is not live, an ECMAScript implementation may perform the following steps atomically:</p>

      <emu-alg>
        1. For each _obj_ of _S_, do
          1. For each WeakRef _ref_ such that _ref_.[[WeakRefTarget]] is _obj_, do
            1. Set _ref_.[[WeakRefTarget]] to ~empty~.
          1. For each FinalizationRegistry _fg_ such that _fg_.[[Cells]] contains _cell_, such that _cell_.[[WeakRefTarget]] is _obj_,
            1. Set _cell_.[[WeakRefTarget]] to ~empty~.
            1. Optionally, perform ! HostCleanupFinalizationRegistry(_fg_).
          1. For each WeakMap _map_ such that _map_.[[WeakMapData]] contains a record _r_ such that _r_.[[Key]] is _obj_,
            1. Remove _r_ from _map_.[[WeakMapData]].
          1. For each WeakSet _set_ such that _set_.[[WeakSetData]] contains _obj_,
            1. Remove _obj_ from _set_.[[WeakSetData]].
      </emu-alg>

      <emu-note>
        <p>
          Together with the definition of liveness, this clause prescribes legal
          optimizations that an implementation may apply regarding WeakRefs.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is possible to access an object without observing its
          identity. Optimizations such as dead variable elimination, and scalar
          replacement on properties of non-escaping objects whose identity is not
          observed, are allowed. These optimizations are thus allowed to
          observably empty WeakRefs that point to such objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, if an object's identity is observable, and that
          object is in the [[WeakRefTarget]] internal slot of a WeakRef, optimizations
          such as rematerialization that observably empty the WeakRef are
          prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because calling HostCleanupFinalizationRegistry is optional, registered objects
          in a FinalizationRegistry do not necessarily hold that FinalizationRegistry live.
          Implementations may omit FinalizationRegistry callbacks for any reason,
          e.g., if the FinalizationRegistry itself becomes dead, or if the application
          is shutting down.
        </p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>
          Implementations are not obligated to empty WeakRefs for maximal sets
          of non-live objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an implementation chooses a non-live set _S_ in which to empty WeakRefs, it
          must empty WeakRefs for all objects in _S_ simultaneously. In other
          words, they must not empty a WeakRef pointing to an object _obj_
          without emptying out other WeakRefs that, if not emptied, could result
          in an execution that observes the Object value of _obj_.
